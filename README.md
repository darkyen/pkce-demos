# pkce-demos
A bunch of PKCE demos, using Auth0.js to extend the üîê to multiple providers!

A demo for the [DCJS ‚ö°Ô∏è talk](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0-tMmWLPOSm7qc5Qam-Ei7BlQ#Hybrid_Apps_and_Oauth). 
The actual read-me will be added later. For now, Use the source, Luke. Also, almost entire code is shared between iOS, Android, Electron and Chrome. The CordovaApp, ElectronApp, ChromeApp folders are used to store configs and manifests for the specific platform.
